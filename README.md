# I Blocks demo
> This project was bootstrapped with [Create Cloud Block](https://github.com/front/create-cloud-block).

This is a collection of blocks as seen on /blockchain. We limited the flexibility to a minimum, to provide a super easy to use UI. We built it so that frontend devs with no Drupal experience can play with it – there is no PHP involved.

**IMPORTANT**: To showcase that we can choosse if we want to re-use existing styles from the main site or not, we simply created a block called "Styles and scripts". Add that as the first block on the page before adding anything else.

Block list:

- Styles and scripts
- Hero
- CTA row
- Featured Solution

A few npm command go get going:


## `npm install`
- Install things

## `npm start`
- Compile and run. Your blocks are now available in Gutenberg on http://localhost:3000
